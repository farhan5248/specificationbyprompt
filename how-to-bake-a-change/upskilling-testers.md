title: Upskill the testers

Once the early adopters have gotten far enough and their way of working is stable, it's time to start working on the early and late majority.
How far is far enough? The should be able to create their own test automation with minimal support.
Basically the test automation developers will now switch from R&D to ramping up the rest of the team so their time can't be spent on supporting as much.

The Xtext plug-in makes it easier to define a custom DSL in Eclipse to write test cases. 
It helps build a language that can be used as an API to write new test cases. 
This helps create generalist testers with T-shaped skills for stream aligned teams.
Transition generating and running as much of the automation to the them. 
This will show them why it's useful to get feedback by running the tests oneself. 
It should save time by eliminating the back and forth between tester and test automator. 

Remember that the regex will keep evolving as more testers use it and the team standardises on writing test cases. 
The more the tester can automate, the faster their tests run, the more free time they gradually build up to learn or try new things. 
The more free time the test automator then has to go and support others or convert existing automation into this new way of working.
